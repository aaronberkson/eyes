# Eyes: Following Mouse Movement

This project illustrates event handling, tracking the x/y coordinates of the userâ€™s mouse movement, in a styled emoji face.


## How to Install and Run the Project
To install and run the project you need the following files in the same directory:

    eyes.js

    index.html

    styles.css

Move your mouse around the emoji to see the eyes follow the mouse.


## How to Use the Project
Open the index file and move your mouse around the emoji to see the eyes follow the mouse, illustrating the tracking of the x,y coordinates of the mousemove event.
If you want to change the look and proportions of the emoji, such as changing the expression, that can be changed in the styles.css file, which defines the look and shape of the face, mouth, eyes, and eyeballs, using gradients and box-shadows of various kinds.
